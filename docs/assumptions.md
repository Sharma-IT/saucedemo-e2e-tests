# Saucedemo E2E Testing Assumptions

## Authentication Assumptions
- Standard user credentials are valid and consistent
- `standard_user` has full access to complete purchase flow
- No multi-factor authentication or additional login steps
- Login credentials remain unchanged during test execution

## Website Structure Assumptions
- Base URL: https://www.saucedemo.com
- Consistent page structure across test runs
- Data-test attributes are reliable selectors
- Inventory page always contains at least one product
- Checkout process follows a predictable, linear flow:
  1. Product Selection
  2. Cart Review
  3. Checkout Information
  4. Order Review
  5. Order Confirmation

## Test Environment Assumptions
- Headless browser testing
- Consistent network conditions
- Browser viewport: 1280x720 pixels
- No external dependencies or third-party integrations
- No geolocation or region-specific variations

## State Management Assumptions
- Each test starts with a clean slate
- No interdependencies between tests
- Cart is reset between tests
- Product inventory remains stable
- No server-side state persistence

## Performance Assumptions
- Page load times under 5 seconds
- Responsive UI with predictable element rendering
- No significant performance variations
- Minimal network latency

## Error Handling Assumptions
- Graceful error handling
- Predictable error messages
- No unexpected modal interruptions
- Retry mechanism can recover from transient failures

## Security Assumptions
- No CAPTCHA or additional verification
- No rate limiting on login or checkout
- No complex bot detection mechanisms

## CI/CD Integration
GitHub Actions workflow configured to:
- Run tests on push and pull requests
- Install dependencies
- Run Playwright tests
- Upload test reports

## Limitations and Known Constraints
- Tests cover happy path scenarios
- Limited edge case testing
- No comprehensive error state validation
- Assumes consistent test environment

## Future Improvement Areas
- Add more comprehensive error scenario tests
- Implement more robust wait strategies
- Enhance selector reliability
- Increase test coverage for edge cases
